            Custom installer class that installs the XNA framework redistributable at the end of a setup project (chained msi install)
            This assembly is intended to be used in a Visual Studio 2008 setup project.
            
            Usage:
            - Open the 'File System Editor' view of the setup project and add this assembly (or this project's output) to the Application Folder.
            - Open the 'Custom Actions Editor' view of the setup project and add this assembly to the Install, Commit, Rollback and Uninstall custom actions.
            - Optional (see defaults below): set the CustomActionData of the Commit custom action to specify the XNA redist file path, command-line args for the XNA redist installer and the XNA version key to use.
            
            By default, it is assumed that:
            - This assembly is in the same folder as the XNA redistributable file
            - The XNA redistributable file name is "Redist\xnafx31_redist.msi"
            - The XNA version key to check is "v3.1"
            - The XNA framework is installed with the "/qn" switch (silent install)
            
            Custom action properties can be specified in the CustomActionData property field of the setup project's Custom Actions view in Visual Studio 2008.
            These properties are only used in the 'Commit' custom action. They are:
            - XnaRedistFile: specifies the XNA framework redist filename. This must be a path relative to XnaInstaller.exe. 
            - XnaRedistArgs: specifies the command-line args of the XNA framework installer. Ex: "/qb" for basic UI, "/qn" for silent installs
            - XnaVersionKey: specifies the version key to use when checking whether the XNA framework is installed. Ex: "v3.1" for XNA fx 3.1
            Example:
            /XnaRedistFile="..\Redist Files\xnafx31_redist.msi" /XnaRedistArgs="/qb" /XnaVersionKey="v3.1"

            Called at the end of the installation. 
            We will start our own assembly in a new process, which will in turn start the XNA install in a second process.
            We can't start the XNA install in this method because Windows Installer has a mutex that prevents two installs from running concurrently.
